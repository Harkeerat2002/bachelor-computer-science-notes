# Computer Science Notes
**Harkeerat Singh Sawhney**
This repo contains mostly all the notes which I have taken during my Computer Science course at the USI Lugano. I hope you find them useful. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. So far this repo contains notes for the years from 2020 to 2023. In my last semester I have taken exchange in ETH Zurich, so the structure of the notes is a bit different. I have also yet to include the notes from Semester 3 and the first half of Semester 6.

## How to use them
The notes are organized in folders, each one containing the notes for a specific course. The notes are written in Markdown, and they are organized in a way that makes them easy to navigate. In order to use them properly, you can use any markdown editor, such as [Typora](https://typora.io/). However, I recommend you to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a great tool for taking notes and linking them together.
