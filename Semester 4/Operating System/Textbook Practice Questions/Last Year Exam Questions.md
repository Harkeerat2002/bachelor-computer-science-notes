## Question 1:
**With respect to file systems, answer the following questions:**

1. **If the operating system were to know that a certain application is going to access the file data in a sequential manner, how could it exploit this information to improve performance?**

2. **What are memory-mapped files? Compare their performance with the performance of regular files.***

## Question 5:
1. **What is Shared Memory, and what are its advantages and disadvantages?**
2. **What is message passing, and what is its addvatanges and disadvantages?**

## Question 7:
**With respect to interrupts, answer the following questions:**

1. **What would a computer system/operating system be like without interrupts? More precisely, what would be the consequences of not having interrupts. What would happen in terms of throughput and response time?**
2. **What is the interrupt vector?**
3. **Why the interrupt vector is usually in the lower end of the memory?**
4. **What would be the consequences of "hardcoding" in hardware the address of the procedures that treat interrupts?**

## Question 8:
**Consider a demand-paging system with the following time-measured utilizations: CPU utilization 20% Paging disk 97.7% Other I/O devices 5%.**

**For each of the following actions: does it improve CPU utilization? Explain why.**

**(a) Install a faster CPU.**

**(b) Install a bigger paging disk.**

**(c) Increase/Decrease the degree of multiprogramming.**

**(d) Install more main memory.**

(**e) Install a faster hard disk or multiple controllers with multiple har**
