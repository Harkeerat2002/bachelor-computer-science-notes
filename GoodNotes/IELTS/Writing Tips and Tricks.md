Topic: The chart shows the amount of money spent on books in the UK in 2018.

**Introduction:** The chart presents data on book spending in the UK during the year 2018. The purpose of this chart is to illustrate the amount of money spent on books in the country, broken down by different categories. Overall, the data shows that the UK population spent a significant amount of money on books in 2018, with certain categories being more popular than others.

**Body Paragraph 1:** The most popular category of books was Fiction, which accounted for almost half of the total spending on books in the UK in 2018. Fiction books were purchased for a total of £2.2 billion, which represents 46% of the total book spending. This suggests that the UK population has a strong interest in reading novels and other works of fiction.

**Body Paragraph 2:** The second most popular category was Non-Fiction, which accounted for 27% of the total spending. Non-fiction books, including biographies, memoirs, and history books, were purchased for a total of £1.3 billion. This suggests that there is a significant interest in learning and expanding knowledge among the UK population.

**Body Paragraph 3:** The least popular category was Children's books, which accounted for only 11% of the total spending. Children's books were purchased for a total of £500 million. This may indicate that parents and guardians are less likely to spend money on books for children, possibly due to the availability of free online resources or a preference for other forms of entertainment.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, the data shows that the UK population spent a significant amount of money on books in 2018. Fiction and Non-fiction books were the most popular categories, while Children's books were the least popular. This data provides insight into the reading habits and interests of the UK population, and suggests that books remain an important part of the country's cultural and intellectual life.

## Example:
**Topic:** Some people believe that technology is making people more isolated and less sociable. Do you agree or disagree?

**Introduction:** Nowadays, technology plays a significant role in our lives. Some argue that technology is making people more isolated and less sociable. In this essay, I will argue that while technology has the potential to create distance between people, it can also facilitate communication and social interaction.

**Body Paragraph 1:** One way in which technology can make people more isolated is through the excessive use of social media. Studies have shown that people who spend too much time on social media are more likely to experience feelings of loneliness and social isolation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that young adults who spent more than two hours a day on social media had a higher risk of social isolation.

**Body Paragraph 2:** However, technology can also facilitate communication and social interaction. For example, video conferencing tools like Zoom and Skype have enabled people to stay connected with family and friends who live far away. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these tools became even more important for maintaining social ties. Moreover, social media platforms can also help people connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies, allowing for the formation of new social networks.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, while it is true that technology can make people more isolated, it can also facilitate communication and social interaction. Rather than demonizing technology, we should use it in a way that promotes social connectedness and fosters meaningful relationships. By doing so, we can reap the benefits of technology while avoiding its potential negative consequences.
